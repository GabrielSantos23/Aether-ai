Hey There, Welcome to Aether AI!

So, you've stumbled upon Aether AI! This isn't just any web app; it's your go-to spot for tapping into some seriously cool AI models. Whether you're trying to cook up creative ideas, get quick answers, or dive deep into research, this app brings all those amazing AI brains right to you in one neat package.
What's This App All About?

Think of this as your personal AI hub! Instead of bouncing between a bunch of different sites or wrestling with complicated APIs, you can chat with top-tier AI providers like Gemini, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Claude, DeepSeek, and more, all from one super clean and easy-to-use interface. Pretty neat, huh?
What Can This Baby Do?

Beyond just spitting out text, this app really flexes its AI muscles to help you out:

    Chat with Lots of AIs: You can easily jump between different AI models, each with its own special powers. Find the perfect AI buddy for whatever you're working on!

    Smart Stuff It Can Do: This isn't your grandma's chatbot! Our AIs can actually:

        Whip Up Images: Just tell it what you're thinking, and boom! It'll generate some awesome visuals for you.

        Browse the Web: Need up-to-the-minute info? The AI can hop online and fetch what you need.

        Do Some Serious "Thinking": For trickier questions, you can watch as the AI breaks things down and gives you really detailed answers. It's like watching a super-smart friend figure things out!

    âœ¨ Compare AIs Side-by-Side (This is HUGE!): Wanna know something really cool? You can ask the exact same question to two different AI providers at the same time! This means you can instantly compare their answers, see how they think differently, and get a wider view on any topic. It's perfect for when you want the full picture or just wanna see who's smarter! ðŸ˜‰

    Smooth Sailing for You: We've made sure using this app is a breeze. It's designed to be super easy to navigate, so you can chat with powerful AI without any headaches.

Under the Hood: What Makes It Tick?

We built this app with some really awesome tech to make sure it's fast, strong, and easy to keep updated:

    Next.js: This is like the powerhouse behind the app, making sure everything runs super smoothly and loads quickly.

    React Router: Helps you zip around between different parts of the app without any fuss.

    Drizzle ORM: This helps us talk to the database in a smart and reliable way.

    Better Auth: Handles all the user logins and security stuff, so you know your account is safe.

    Supabase: Our backend superstar, giving us a solid database, user authentication, and real-time magic!
